Proper software design knowledge is a requirement for IT professional. There
are dozens of recommendations on how to create robust and scalable solutions,
and there is already a lot of literature, like GoF's "Design Patterns",
Fowler's "Enterprise Patterns", etc.

This repo supposed to be a place to condense the most intriguing and effective

necessarily be provided with motivation sections and practical examples of
usage.
